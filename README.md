# Paint-Brush

##Description

This is a simple java applet implementation of a paint-brush style program. It has the basic drawing tools such as pen, line, filled and non-filed rectangles and ellipses and color manipulation options, other than that its really boring, but a good example of how to use java's graphics libraries.
